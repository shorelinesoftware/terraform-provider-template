# shoreline_resource (Resource)

Resources are the infrastructure objects managed by Shoreline.  A Resources refers to a specific host, pod, or container throughout the Shoreline platform. It may also refer to a more distinct entity, such as a virtual machine or a database instance.

Resources types are platform and provider agnostic. So whether it's a fleet of pods and containers in Kubernetes, stand-alone hosts, or many virtual machines, Shoreline can control those Resourcess within AWS, GCP, or Azure.

-> Shoreline Resources are not to be confused with Terraform resources.

## Required Properties

- name - A unique name for the Resource resource.
- value - A valid Op statement that defines a valid Resource query.

## Usage

Shoreline Resources are effectively aliases for more complex Resource queries.  For example, the following definition creates a custom Resource called `az_k8s` as an alias for the full query to target Kubernetes pods on Azure:

```tf
resource "shoreline_resource" "az_k8s" {
  name        = "${var.namespace}_az_k8s"
  value       = "hosts | k8s=true | cloud_provider='azure' | pods | namespace=[\"${var.namespace}\"]"
  description = "All Shoreline Kubernetes pods on Azure"
}
```

-> See the Shoreline Resources documentation for more info.
